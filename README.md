Playing with Compression
========================

I recently read a popsci book about Assembly Theory (Life as No One Knows It)
which puts forward a complexity argument for life founded in nothing more than
physics probabilities of complexity. The number they arrive at is 15, but that's
neither here nor there. What I discovered upon looking into it is that much work
has already been done to explore the way the emergence of life can be statistically
predicted based on the compression level of the molecules in a potential source of
living material.

This repository has all the pertienent datasets used to refute the novelty of Assembly
Theory: https://github.com/Abicumaran/MSComplexity/tree/main

But my main curiosity as a result of learning about all this is in the nature of
compression algorithims. Thus, I'm playing around with different methods, starting
with one of the original Huffman algo, which is both simple and elegant, making it
fun to play with.

At it's most basic, it's a binary tree representation of the frequency of characters
in the input string.
